## 🔄 New Workflow Implementation

### Phase 1: Data Preparation ✅
```bash
python3 data_preprocessing.py
```
- Downloads TIScode and UrbanSound8K datasets via Kaggle
- Generates noisy audio by mixing clean audio with urban noise
- Converts audio to STFT spectrograms (1024 FFT, 256 hop)
- Normalizes spectrograms and saves as .npy files in `spec_arrays/`

### Phase 2: Individual Model Training ✅
```bash
python3 unet_model.py             # Trains U-Net independently
python3 attention_unet_model.py   # Trains Attention U-Net independently  
python3 cnn_transformer_model.py  # Trains CNN-Transformer independently
```

Each script:
- ✅ Loads preprocessed data from `spec_arrays/`
- ✅ Builds and compiles the model architecture
- ✅ Trains for 50 epochs with early stopping (patience=10)
- ✅ Evaluates on test data with comprehensive metrics
- ✅ Saves complete results to `model_results/[model_name]_results.pkl`
- ✅ Saves trained model weights to `models_dir/`

### Phase 3: Results Comparison ✅
```bash
python3 main_comparison.py
```
- ✅ Loads saved results from all trained models
- ✅ Displays detailed performance comparison tables
- ✅ Generates training history plots (`model_comparison.png`)
- ✅ Creates spectrogram comparison visualizations (`spectrogram_comparison.png`)
- ✅ Generates denoised audio samples in `generated_audio/`

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### ✅ Problem Resolution
- **Fixed circular import issue**: Renamed `code.py` → `original_code.py`
- **Memory optimization**: Implemented batch processing for large datasets
- **Stability improvements**: Added mixed precision support and error handling
- **Modular architecture**: Created independent, reusable components

### ✅ Enhanced Functionality
- **Standalone execution**: Each model can be trained independently
- **Result persistence**: Training results saved as pickle files for later analysis
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: 5 metrics (MSE, MAE, SSIM, PSNR, Cosine Similarity)
- **Visualization suite**: Training curves, metric comparisons, spectrograms
- **Audio generation**: Converts denoised spectrograms back to playable audio

### ✅ Model Implementations
1. **U-Net**: Fast implementation with separable convolutions (~2.7M parameters)
2. **Attention U-Net**: Enhanced with attention gates for better feature selection (~3.2M parameters)
3. **CNN-Transformer**: Hybrid architecture with patch-based transformers (~4.1M parameters)

### ✅ Data Pipeline
- **Dataset integration**: Automated download from Kaggle
- **Noise synthesis**: Realistic urban noise addition
- **Efficient processing**: Memory-friendly 500-sample batching
- **Format standardization**: Consistent spectrogram normalization

## 🚀 Ready to Use

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Configure Kaggle API**: Place credentials in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
3. **Run preprocessing**: `python3 data_preprocessing.py`
4. **Train models**: Run each model script individually
5. **Compare results**: `python3 main_comparison.py`

### Expected Outputs:
- **Training data**: `spec_arrays/` directory with normalized spectrograms
- **Model weights**: `models_dir/` directory with .h5 files
- **Results**: `model_results/` directory with pickle files
- **Visualizations**: `.png` files with comparison plots
- **Audio samples**: `generated_audio/` directory with denoised audio
